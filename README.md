Security Software Subterfuge Standard
=====================================

* _The VT counterattack_: Our heuristics would catch the bastard
* _The APT Argument_: This is a highly sophisticated / state sponsored attack
* _We have an app for that_: The victim didn't use the most expensive version of our product
* _Blame the Customer_: The victim didn't turn this hidden feature on
* _Gold Certification_: But this study proves that our product rocks!
* _Ad hominem_: You are trying to undermine the security of our users!!!1
